            To optimize the overall user experience of Luxy, we will optimize the BLACK Message function. Please accept our sincere apologies for any inconvenience caused to you through this experience.
            <br>
            <br>
            After X. Xth, the BLACK Message function will be adjusted as follows:
            You won't be able to send messages to NOT MATCHED users continuously by using the BLACK Message privilege until you successfully MATCH with them. Once both sides are matched successfully, the conversation will begin.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            We are changing this procedure because Luxy believes a relationship should be based on mutual love. This adjustment will ensure to respect ALL Luxy userâ€™s choices and help our dear members to build better relationships.
            <br>
            <br>
            The reason we are implementing this new rule is because 60% of our users have been exposed to different levels of harassment in the year of 2018. This is a tough issue that can't be evaded. It occurred due to a wrong choice of our strategy what incentivized our users to operate in an incorrect way. We believe that this is not what our users should expect.
            <br>
            <br>
            We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience caused by our adjustments, and will compensate every affected user with 1000 Coins. We hope you will enjoy this improved service from Luxy. Thank you for sharing us your trust!

            Currently, there are several deficiencies on Luxy, and we are striving to optimize our services to continue in maintaining a high-quality community. In the meantime, we hope that all users will cherish their matches, instead of ignoring or snubbing them.
